MagCalc is a powerful software tool designed for predicting magnetization as a function of temperature, utilizing a trained model from the Vampire software. 

MagCalc is a software designed to analyze and compute the magnetic characteristics of FePt (Iron-Platinum) material, consisting of iron (Fe) and platinum (Pt). This material is renowned for its outstanding magnetic characteristics, especially in magnetic storage systems like hard disk drives. FePt demonstrates significant magnetic anisotropy, rendering it a permanent magnet that can preserve its magnetic characteristics at diminutive dimensions and elevated temperatures. The application computes magnetization throughout a temperature spectrum of 0-900K, enabling users to define the material's thickness and diameter as required. It autonomously calculates magnetization as a function of temperature (Magnetization vs. Temperature).

MagCalc distinguishes itself with the application of a machine learning model developed from atomic-level simulations conducted with Vampire software. The data produced from these simulations allows the ML model to comprehend the magnetic characteristics and properties of FePt across different temperatures and variables, including thickness and diameter. Upon training the ML model, it may swiftly forecast the magnetization of FePt without necessitating additional simulations, so drastically decreasing computation time from around 3 hours every simulation to just 1 second per calculation. With MagCalc's quick performance and excellent accuracy, users may effectively evaluate and investigate the magnetic behavior of FePt materials.
